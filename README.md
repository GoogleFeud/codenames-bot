If you want to self-host the bot, clone or fork this repository. Then, do `npm i` in the folder where `package.json` is. **You must have node.js version ^12.0.0 installed.**

**Note:** Do not host on heruko! The `canvas` module breaks if it's hosted on heruko. The board won't be displayed correctly!
