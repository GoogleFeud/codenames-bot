- npm 
- If your OS is windows, you need the `Windows Build Tools`. Install them via `npm i --global --production windows-build-tools`
- If your OS is Linux/Ubuntu, you need the `build-essentials` package. Install it via `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
- A discord bot application. [Here's a good tutorial on how to create a bot application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
